Keep in mind that you can submit unstructured data for PII detection, which makes it versatile for various data formats.|CAUTION ALERT - Avoid thinking that data retention for a few hours is related to synchronous detection; itâ€™s not relevant for PII detection workflows. Stay clear of misinformation about data retention in the context of PII."
"Qn48","mcq_options","Option A) Statement I |Option B) Statement II |Option C) Statement III |Option D) Statement I, Statement II |Option E) Statement II, Statement III."
"Qn48","mcq_wrong_option_reason","Option C - Retaining data for a few hours is not related to synchronous PII detection.|Option E - Statement III is incorrect, making this option invalid."
"Qn49","mcq_question","As part of a project to develop a generative AI model for creating customized travel itineraries, you are responsible for designing prompts to guide the model's decision-making process. To ensure the generated itineraries are comprehensive and tailored to user preferences, which approach should you prioritize when crafting the prompts? Select all answers that apply."
"Qn49","mcq_answer","Answer - [A, B]"
"Qn49","mcq_answer_reason","Option A - Including destination preferences, travel dates, and activity interests helps create tailored itineraries.|Option B - Providing budget constraints and accommodation preferences ensures cost-effective travel plans.|EXAM FOCUS - You should include destination preferences, travel dates, and budget constraints in prompts to guide Azureâ€™s generative AI models for personalized itineraries. Keep in mind these key details help the AI generate tailored and relevant travel suggestions.|CAUTION ALERT - Avoid relying solely on transportation options or feedback refinementâ€”they may not provide enough guidance for comprehensive itinerary generation. Stay cautioned that prompt experimentation without structure may lead to inconsistent results."
"Qn49","mcq_options","Option A) Including destination preferences, travel dates, and activity interests. |Option B) Providing budget constraints and accommodation preferences. |Option C) Incorporating transportation options and journey durations. |Option D) Leveraging user feedback on previous travel suggestions. |Option E) Experimenting with different prompt formulations."
"Qn49","mcq_wrong_option_reason","Option C - Transportation details help but do not directly guide itinerary personalization.|Option D - User feedback refines suggestions but is not necessary for initial prompt crafting.|Option E - Experimenting with prompts can be useful but does not guarantee tailored itineraries."
"Qn50","mcq_question","You are designing an AI-driven recommendation system for an e-commerce platform that utilizes generative AI to suggest personalized product bundles to customers. Which architectural consideration should you prioritize to ensure seamless integration of generative AI into the solution while meeting scalability requirements? Select all answers that apply."
"Qn50","mcq_answer","Answer - [A, C]"
"Qn50","mcq_answer_reason","Option A - Implementing a microservices architecture allows independent scaling of generative AI components.|Option C - Leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) ensures efficient orchestration of containerized AI models.|EXAM FOCUS - You need to implement a microservices architecture and leverage Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalability in your generative AI solution. Always remember that AKS helps manage dynamic resource allocation for containerized models.|CAUTION ALERT - Stay clear of using serverless architectures for this taskâ€”they are better suited for event-driven processes, not AI model orchestration. Avoid thinking Azure Batch or Data Factory will address real-time scalabilityâ€”they are more suitable for batch processing and data pipelines."
"Qn50","mcq_options","Option A) Implementing a microservices architecture to modularize generative AI components and enable independent scaling of services. |Option B) Deploying a serverless architecture using Azure Functions to automatically scale resources based on demand. |Option C) Leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to orchestrate containerized generative AI models and manage resource allocation dynamically. |Option D) Utilizing Azure Batch to schedule and execute large-scale generative AI training jobs across distributed computing resources. |Option E) Implementing Azure Data Factory to orchestrate data pipelines and facilitate seamless data ingestion for generative AI models."
"Qn50","mcq_wrong_option_reason","Option B - Serverless architectures work well for event-driven applications but may not provide optimal control over AI model orchestration.|Option D - Azure Batch is suited for scheduled workloads, not real-time AI inference.|Option E - Azure Data Factory is useful for data processing but does not manage AI model scalability."
